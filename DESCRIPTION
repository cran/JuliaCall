Description: Provides an R interface to 'Julia',
    which is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language
    for numerical computing, see <https://julialang.org/> for more information.
    It provides a high-level interface as well as a low-level interface.
    Using the high level interface, you could call any 'Julia' function just like
    any R function with automatic type conversion. Using the low level interface,
    you could deal with C-level SEXP directly while enjoying the convenience of
    using a high-level programming language like 'Julia'.
