Package `JuliaCall` is an R interface to `Julia`, which is a high-level,
high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing,
see <https://julialang.org/> for more information. Below is an image for
[Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
JuliaCall brings **more than 100 times speedup** of the calculation\!
See
<https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/example/mandelbrot>
for more
information.

## Installation

To use package `JuliaCall`, you first have to install
[`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) on your computer, you can download a
generic binary from <https://julialang.org/downloads/> and add it to
your path, and then you can install `JuliaCall` just like any other R
packages by

``` r
install.packages("JuliaCall")
```

Note that currently `Julia v0.6.x`, `Julia v0.7.0` and `Julia v1.0` are
all supported by `JuliaCall`. But note that some `Julia` packages may
not work on `Julia v1.0` and you may need to use `Julia v0.7.0` for
transition purposes.

You can get the development version of `JuliaCall` by

``` r
devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall")
```

## Basic Usage

``` r
library(JuliaCall)

## Do initial setup

julia <- julia_setup()
#> Julia version 1.0.3 at location /Applications/Julia-1.0.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin will be used.
#> Loading setup script for JuliaCall...
#> Finish loading setup script for JuliaCall.

## If you want to use a julia at a specific location, you could do the following:
## julia_setup(JULIA_HOME = "the folder that contains julia binary"), 
## or you can set JULIA_HOME in command line environment or use `options(...)`

## Different ways for using Julia to calculate sqrt(2)

# julia$command("a = sqrt(2);"); julia$eval("a")
julia_command("a = sqrt(2);"); julia_eval("a")
#> [1] 1.414214
julia_eval("sqrt(2)")
#> [1] 1.414214
julia_call("sqrt", 2)
#> [1] 1.414214
julia_eval("sqrt")(2)
#> [1] 1.414214
julia_assign("x", sqrt(2)); julia_eval("x")
#> [1] 1.414214
julia_assign("rsqrt", sqrt); julia_call("rsqrt", 2)
#> [1] 1.414214
2 %>J% sqrt
#> [1] 1.414214

## You can use `julia$exists` as `exists` in R to test
## whether a function or name exists in Julia or not

julia_exists("sqrt")
#> [1] TRUE
julia_exists("c")
#> [1] FALSE

## Functions related to installing and using Julia packages

julia_install_package_if_needed("Optim")
julia_installed_package("Optim")
#> [1] "0.17.2"
julia_library("Optim")
```

## Trouble Shooting and Way to Get Help

### Julia is not found

Make sure the `Julia` installation is correct. `JuliaCall` is able to
find `Julia` on PATH, and there are three ways for `JuliaCall` to find
`Julia` not on PATH.

  - Use `julia_setup(JULIA_HOME = "the folder that contains julia
    binary")`
  - Use `options(JULIA_HOME = "the folder that contains julia binary")`
  - Set `JULIA_HOME` in command line environment.

### How to Get Help

  - One way to get help for julia functions is just using `julia$help`
    like the following example:

<!-- end list -->

```` r
julia_help("sqrt")
#> ```
#> sqrt(x)
#> ```
#> 
#> Return $\sqrt{x}$. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments instead. The prefix operator `√` is equivalent to `sqrt`.
#> 
#> # Examples
#> 
#> ```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
#> julia> sqrt(big(81))
#> 9.0
#> 
#> julia> sqrt(big(-81))
#> ERROR: DomainError with -8.1e+01:
#> NaN result for non-NaN input.
#> Stacktrace:
#>  [1] sqrt(::BigFloat) at ./mpfr.jl:501
#> [...]
#> 
#> julia> sqrt(big(complex(-81)))
#> 0.0 + 9.0im
#> ```
#> 
#> ```
#> sqrt(A::AbstractMatrix)
#> ```
#> 
#> If `A` has no negative real eigenvalues, compute the principal matrix square root of `A`, that is the unique matrix $X$ with eigenvalues having positive real part such that $X^2 = A$. Otherwise, a nonprincipal square root is returned.
#> 
#> If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the square root. Otherwise, the square root is determined by means of the Björck-Hammarling method [^BH83], which computes the complex Schur form ([`schur`](@ref)) and then the complex square root of the triangular factor.
#> 
#> [^BH83]: Åke Björck and Sven Hammarling, "A Schur method for the square root of a matrix", Linear Algebra and its Applications, 52-53, 1983, 127-140. [doi:10.1016/0024-3795(83)80010-X](https://doi.org/10.1016/0024-3795(83)80010-X)
#> 
#> # Examples
#> 
#> ```jldoctest
#> julia> A = [4 0; 0 4]
#> 2×2 Array{Int64,2}:
#>  4  0
#>  0  4
#> 
#> julia> sqrt(A)
#> 2×2 Array{Float64,2}:
#>  2.0  0.0
#>  0.0  2.0
#> ```

## JuliaCall for R Package Developers

If you are interested in developing an R package which is an interface
for a Julia package, `JuliaCall` is an ideal choice for that\!

Basically you only need to find the Julia function or Julia module you
want to have in `R` and then just `using` the module and `call` the
function. Several examples are:

  - [`diffeqr`](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/diffeqr) is a package for
    solving differential equations in `R`. It utilizes
    [DifferentialEquations.jl](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/) for
    its core routines to give high performance solving of ordinary
    differential equations (ODEs), stochastic differential equations
    (SDEs), delay differential equations (DDEs), and
    differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) directly in `R`.
  - [`convexjlr`](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/convexjlr) is an
    `R` package for Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) by providing a
    high level wrapper for `Julia` package
    [`Convex.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl). `convexjlr`
    can solve linear programs, second order cone programs, semidefinite
    programs, exponential cone programs, mixed-integer linear programs,
    and some other DCP-compliant convex programs through `Convex.jl`.
  - [`ipoptjlr`](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/ipoptjlr) provides
    an `R` interface to the `Ipopt` nonlinear optimization solver. It
    provides a simple high-level wrapper for `Julia` package
    \[`Ipopt.jl`\] (<https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Ipopt.jl>).
  - [Julia MixedModels from R](http://rpubs.com/dmbates/377897)
    illustrates how to use `JuliaCall` and `Julia` package
    [`MixedModels.jl`](https://github.com/dmbates/MixedModels.jl) to
    build mixed models in `R`.
  - [`autodiffr`](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/autodiffr)
    provides automatic differentiation to native `R` functions by
    wrapping `Julia` packages
    [`ForwardDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) and
    [`ReverseDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl)
    through `JuliaCall`, which is a work in progress.

If you have any issues in developing an `R` package using `JuliaCall`,
you may report it using the link:
<https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/issues/new>. Or email me
at <lch34677@gmail.com> or <cxl508@psu.edu>.

## Suggestion and Issue Reporting

`JuliaCall` is under active development now. Any suggestion or issue
reporting is welcome\! You may report it using the link:
<https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/issues/new>. Or email me
at <lch34677@gmail.com> or <cxl508@psu.edu>.

And if you encounter some issues which crash `R` or `RStudio`, then you
may have met segfault errors. I am very sorry. And I am trying my best
to remove errors like that. It will be much appreciated if you can

  - download the source of `JuliaCall` from Github,
  - open `JuliaCall.Rproj` in your RStudio or open `R` from the
    directory where you download the source of `JuliaCall`,
  - run `devtools::check()` to see the result of `R CMD check` for
    `JuliaCall` on your machine,
  - and paste the result to the issue report.

## Interfaces between R and Julia

  - [`RCall.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl) is a `Julia`
    package which embeds `R` in `Julia`. `JuliaCall` is inspired by
    `RCall.jl` and depends on `RCall.jl` for many functionalities like
    much of the type conversion between `R` and `Julia`.
  - [`XRJulia`](https://github.com/johnmchambers/XRJulia) is an `R`
    package based on John Chambers’ `XR` package and allow for
    structured integration of `R` with `Julia`. It connects to `Julia`
    and uses JSON to transfer data between `Julia` and `R`.
  - [`RJulia`](https://github.com/armgong/rjulia) is an `R` package
    which embeds `Julia` in `R` as well as `JuliaCall`. It is not on
    CRAN yet and I haven’t tested it.
