## Use JuliaCall as Julia Engine in R Markdown

To use `JuliaCall` package for julia engine in R Markdown document.
Just set the engine for julia to `JuliaCall::eng_juliacall` like this:

```{r setup}
knitr::knit_engines$set(julia = JuliaCall::eng_juliacall)
```

```{julia}
## This is a julia language chunk.
## In julia, the command without ending semicolon will trigger the display
## so is JuliaCall package. 
## The julia display will follow immediately after the corresponding command
## just as the R code in R Markdown.
a = sqrt(2)
a = sqrt(2);

## And lots of different types of display are supported in JuliaCall.
## Like markdown.
@doc sqrt
```

## Get Access to Julia in R Chunk

And you can also get access to julia variables in R code chunk quite easily
using `JuliaCall`, for example:
```{r}
## This is a R language chunk.
## In the previous julia chunk, we define variable a, 
## we can use functions in JuliaCall to get access to it.
JuliaCall::julia_eval("a")
```


## Current Limitations

Currently only R Markdown html output is fully supported by
`JuliaCall`.

## Custom Style of Julia Display in R Markdown Using CSS

When using `JuliaCall` in R Markdown,
every julia display will be wrapped in 
a div with `class = "JuliaDisplay"`,
so you could customize the looking of julia display using css,
for example, I use

```
    <style>
    .JuliaDisplay {
        color: blue;
    }
    </style>
```

in this document.
